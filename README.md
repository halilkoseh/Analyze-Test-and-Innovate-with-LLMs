Summary of the project
In this study, it is aimed to develop a platform that will be able to perform unit tests, interface tests and interpretation of the code given as input, by using large language model (LLM) agents and supporting at least 3 programming languages. The platform to be developed will take the code block as input and produce output in line with the user's requests (unit, interface, code comment).



Welcome to the AI-Based Interactive Software Development Platform with LLM Agents! This platform harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize software development by supporting multiple programming languages and offering advanced features like code analysis, interpretation, unit testing, and interface testing.

Features
Multi-Language Support:

The platform supports various programming languages, making it accessible for developers across different tech stacks.
Code Analysis:

Provides intelligent insights into code structure, potential bugs, and optimization opportunities.
Code Interpretation:

Offers clear interpretations of code snippets, making it easier to understand complex logic.
Unit Testing:

Automates unit testing for faster and more reliable software validation.
Interface Testing:

Simplifies UI/UX testing processes with AI-driven simulations and validations.
Customizable Outputs:

Tailors results and recommendations based on user requirements.
Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Laravel
AI Integration: Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Codex, or similar)
Frontend: Vue.js (or preferred framework/library for UI components)
Database: MySQL (or other supported databases in Laravel)
